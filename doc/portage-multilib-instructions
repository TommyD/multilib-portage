First, if you want to install and use it via layman:

1.
layman -a multilib-portage

2.
emerge -av1 portage

remember that multilib-portage is following the 2.2* branch of portage,
so it only has testing keywords

3.
check the target of /etc/make.profile
rm /etc/make.profile
mkdir /etc/make.profile
echo /path/to/current/profile >> /etc/make.profile/parent
echo /path/to/multilib-overlay/profiles/base >> /etc/make.profile/parent

4.
let the multilib overlay eclasses override the main tree ones: add the 
following to /etc/portage/repos.conf or create it with the following
content:

[DEFAULT]
eclass-overrides = gentoo multilib
[multilib]
eclass-overrides = gentoo multilib

5.

then either recompile world:

emerge -e world

or use /path/to/multilib-overlay/bin/add_multilib_abi to add the useflag
to the database. In this case, you might have to run
/usr/bin/lafilefixer once since multilib-portage does remove most of
.la files during install stage
